 *
 * @param triggerTimeMs Extra milliseconds to hold **after the previous stage** before this stage
 *   becomes current (after finger-down for Stage 1). The runtime sums these into absolute thresholds.
 * @param action        Action executed on release while this stage is active.
 * @param hapticFeedback Haptic pulse played once when transitioning into this stage.
 *                      Null falls back to the point's own haptic setting.
